# FoundationChat ðŸ’¬

A modern, cross-platform chat application for iOS and macOS built with SwiftUI. This project makes use of Apple's `FoundationModels` to use its generative AI features and `MarkdownUI` for rich message rendering.

## Overview

FoundationChat is built entirely with SwiftUI, ensuring a native look and feel on both iOS and macOS. The core of the application is its integration with large language models through Apple's new **Foundation Models API**, allowing for intelligent and dynamic conversations.
